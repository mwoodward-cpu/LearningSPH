Data set can be sent upon request:
 Initial Condition (IC) of data is from sph equilibrium IC found from forward solving SPH with no external forcing until particles settle into an equilibrium position. Then noninertial particles are injected into a DNS flow and integrated forward in time. These particles are used to compare (and train loss) on statistics.
